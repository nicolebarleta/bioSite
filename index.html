           <h2>The Graphic Artist</h2>
          Alex is my inspiration when it comes to arts. Whenever I have creative issues; I can always asks her for help.
          Because of her, I appreciate what arts can do for people; a lot of emotions can be perceived in every piece of art.
          She can make people smile through her.

        She started learning to draw anime characters when she was 10 yrs. old,
        at a young age she wanted to create her own manga (anime comics).
        To practice her skill she then continued making artworks of her favorite characters and
        sold them in anime conventions as posters, bookmarks and caricatures.
